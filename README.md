# Magic
This project aim to out-meta the metagame in Magic: The Gathering by scaping the contents of the winning decks in tournament
results posted on mtggoldfish.com and using machine learning to assemble decks that represent the best possible version of
popular deck archetypes.

To-do:
-add Juptyer notebook explaining the process
-implement a solution to the knapsack problem to automate deck construction (current iteration just ranks cards)

Possible extensions:
-Track color devotion over time
-Track and publish weekly updates of meta-analysis
